#Introduction

##Application Fundamentals

Once installed on a device, each Android app lives in its own security sandbox:
+ The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.
+ By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.系统为每个应用分配一个User ID.
+ Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps.
+ By default, every app runs in its own Linux process. Android starts the process when any of the app's components need to be executed, then shuts down the process when it's no longer needed or when the system must recover memory for other apps.每个应用运行在自己的进程中，应用的一个组件需要启动的时候，应用的进程就会启动。

However, there are ways for an app to share data with other apps and for an app to access system services:
+ It's possible to arrange for two apps to share the same Linux user ID, in which case they are able to access each other's files. To conserve system resources, apps with the same user ID can also arrange to run in the same Linux process and share the same VM (the apps must also be signed with the same certificate).可以为两个应用设置一个共享User ID，这样他们就可以访问彼此的文件。为了节省系统资源，可以让两个应用运行在一个进程中，共享同一个VM。前提是应用必须使用相同的签名。
+ An app can request permission to access device data such as the user's contacts, SMS messages, the mountable storage (SD card), camera, Bluetooth, and more. All app permissions must be granted by the user at install time.

When the system starts a component, it starts the process for that app (if it's not already running) and instantiates the classes needed for the component. For example, if your app starts the activity in the camera app that captures a photo, that activity runs in the process that belongs to the camera app, not in your app's process. Therefore, unlike apps on most other systems, Android apps don't have a single entry point (there's no main() function, for example).应用启动其他应用中的组件时，其他应用的进程会起来，所以Android 应用没有一个单独的进入点。

Because the system runs each app in a separate process with file permissions that restrict access to other apps, your app cannot directly activate a component from another app. The Android system, however, can. So, to activate a component in another app, you must deliver a message to the system that specifies your intent to start a particular component. The system then activates the component for you.由于权限限制，A应用不能直接启动B应用，要想启动B应用，A应用必须给系统发消息指定要启动的应用或者组件，系统就会激活那个组件或者应用。

Three of the four component types—activities, services, and broadcast receivers—are activated by an asynchronous message called an intent. Intents bind individual components to each other at runtime (you can think of them as the messengers that request an action from other components), whether the component belongs to your app or another.``Activity``，``Service``，``BroadcastReceiver``可以被``Intent``激活。``ContentProvider``是从别处调用``ContentResolver``时间接调用的。For activities and services, an intent defines the action to perform (for example, to "view" or "send" something) and may specify the URI of the data to act on (among other things that the component being started might need to know). 对``Activity``和``Service``来说，``Intent``指定要做的动作。For broadcast receivers, the intent simply defines the announcement being broadcast (for example, a broadcast to indicate the device battery is low includes only a known action string that indicates "battery is low").对``BroadcastReceiver``来说，``Intent``只是指定要广播的声明。The other component type, content provider, is not activated by intents. Rather, it is activated when targeted by a request from a ``ContentResolver``. The content resolver handles all direct transactions with the content provider so that the component that's performing transactions with the provider doesn't need to and instead calls methods on the ``ContentResolver`` object. This leaves a layer of abstraction between the content provider and the component requesting information (for security).``ContentProvider``是被``ContentResolver``请求激活的。``ContentResolver``是直接请求操作的组件和``ContentProvider``之间的一个抽象层。

There are separate methods for activating each type of component:

+ You can start an activity (or give it something new to do) by passing an Intent to ``startActivity()`` or ``startActivityForResult()`` (when you want the activity to return a result).
+ You can start a service (or give new instructions to an ongoing service) by passing an Intent to ``startService()``. Or you can bind to the service by passing an Intent to ``bindService()``.
+ You can initiate a broadcast by passing an Intent to methods like ``sendBroadcast()``, ``sendOrderedBroadcast()``, or ``sendStickyBroadcast()``.
You can perform a query to a content provider by calling ``query()`` on a ``ContentResolver``.

Before the Android system can start an app component, the system must know that the component exists by reading the app's ``AndroidManifest.xml`` file (the "manifest" file). Your app must declare all its components in this file, which must be at the root of the app project directory.

The manifest does a number of things in addition to declaring the app's components, such as:

+ Identify any user permissions the app requires, such as Internet access or read-access to the user's contacts.
+ Declare the minimum API Level required by the app, based on which APIs the app uses.
+ Declare hardware and software features used or required by the app, such as a camera, bluetooth services, or a multitouch screen.
+ API libraries the app needs to be linked against (other than the Android framework APIs), such as the Google Maps library.
+ And more

The way the system identifies the components that can respond to an intent is by comparing the intent received to the intent filters provided in the manifest file of other apps on the device.系统判断一个组件是否响应某个Intent的依据是比较发出的Intent与manifest文件中组件声明的intent filter。

There are a variety of devices powered by Android and not all of them provide the same features and capabilities. In order to prevent your app from being installed on devices that lack features needed by your app, it's important that you clearly define a profile for the types of devices your app supports by declaring device and software requirements in your manifest file. Most of these declarations are informational only and the system does not read them, but external services such as Google Play do read them in order to provide filtering for users when they search for apps from their device.


##Device Compatibility

Android execution environment are defined by the Android compatibility program and each device must pass the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) in order to be considered compatible.Android设备必须通过CTS测试。

In order for you to manage your app’s availability based on device features, Android defines feature IDs for any hardware or software feature that may not be available on all devices. For instance, the feature ID for the compass sensor is ``FEATURE_SENSOR_COMPASS`` and the feature ID for app widgets is ``FEATURE_APP_WIDGETS``.Android为硬件feature和软件feature定义了feature id。

If necessary, you can prevent users from installing your app when their devices don't provide a given feature by declaring it with a ``<uses-feature>``element in your app's manifest file.

Google Play Store compares the features your app requires to the features available on each user's device to determine whether your app is compatible with each device. If the device does not provide all the features your app requires, the user cannot install your app.GooglePlayStore会对用户设备进行判断。

However, if your app's primary functionality does not require a device feature, you should set the required attribute to "false" and check for the device feature at runtime. If the app feature is not available on the current device, gracefully degrade the corresponding app feature. For example, you can query whether a feature is available by calling ``hasSystemFeature()`` like this:
```xml
<manifest ... >
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.sensor.compass"
                  android:required="false" />
    ...
</manifest>
```

```java
PackageManager pm = getPackageManager();
if (!pm.hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_SENSOR_COMPASS)) {
    // This device does not have a compass, turn off the compass feature
    disableCompassFeature();
}
```

The ``targetSdkVersion`` attribute does not prevent your app from being installed on platform versions that are higher than the specified value, but it is important because it indicates to the system whether your app should inherit behavior changes in newer versions. If you don't update the ``targetSdkVersion`` to the latest version, the system assumes that your app requires some backward-compatibility behaviors when running on the latest version. For example, among the [behavior changes in Android 4.4](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.4.html#Behaviors), alarms created with the ``AlarmManager`` APIs are now inexact by default so the system can batch app alarms and preserve system power, but the system will retain the previous API behavior for your app if your target API level is lower than "19".``targetSdkVersion``小于当前设备sdk version的应用将会被保留老版本sdk特性。

However, if your app uses APIs added in a more recent platform version, but does not require them for its primary functionality, you should check the API level at runtime and gracefully degrade the corresponding features when the API level is too low. In this case, set the ``minSdkVersion`` to the lowest value possible for your app's primary functionality, then compare the current system's version, ``SDK_INT``, to one the codename constants in ``Build.VERSION_CODES`` that corresponds to the API level you want to check. For example:可以在运行时比较当前设备系统版本，来决定是否使用某些特性。

```java
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB) {
    // Running on something older than API level 11, so disable
    // the drag/drop features that use ClipboardManager APIs
    disableDragAndDrop();
}
```

Filtering for technical compatibility (such as required hardware components) is always based on information contained within your APK file. But filtering for non-technical reasons (such as geographic locale) is always handled in the Google Play developer console.技术方面的过滤在代码中完成，非技术方面的过滤，如限制某个国家的人不能下载该应用，可以在google play store完成。

##System Permissions

Android is a privilege-separated operating system, in which each application runs with a distinct system identity (Linux user ID and group ID). Parts of the system are also separated into distinct identities. Linux thereby isolates applications from each other and from the system.Additional finer-grained security features are provided through a "permission" mechanism that enforces restrictions on the specific operations that a particular process can perform, and per-URI permissions for granting ad hoc access to specific pieces of data.Linux本身的多用户机制已经使Android比较安全了，Android为一些特定的操作提供了``permission``机制，只有获取了``permission``才能进行相关敏感的操作，如获取网络等。

A central design point of the Android security architecture is that no application, by default, has permission to perform any operations that would adversely impact other applications, the operating system, or the user. This includes reading or writing the user's private data (such as contacts or emails), reading or writing another application's files, performing network access, keeping the device awake, and so on.Android安全架构的核心是应用默认没有权限去进行敏感的操作。Because each Android application operates in a process sandbox, applications must explicitly share resources and data. They do this by declaring the permissions they need for additional capabilities not provided by the basic sandbox. Applications statically declare the permissions they require, and the Android system prompts the user for consent at the time the application is installed. Android has no mechanism for granting permissions dynamically (at run-time) because it complicates the user experience to the detriment of security.应用要进行敏感操作，必须在manifest文件中声明需要的permission，由用户在安装的时候进行确认。

All APKs (.apk files) must be signed with a certificate whose private key is held by their developer.The purpose of certificates in Android is to distinguish application authors. This allows the system to grant or deny applications access to signature-level permissions and to grant or deny an application's request to be given the same Linux identity as another application.所有的APK文件必须被签名，签名的目的是分辨应用的作者。这样就为系统在为应用授权或拒绝``signature-level permission``或分配和其他应用相同User ID时提供了依据。

At install time, Android gives each package a distinct Linux user ID. The identity remains constant for the duration of the package's life on that device. On a different device, the same package may have a different UID; what matters is that each package has a distinct UID on a given device.应用在安装时会被分配一个User ID。Because security enforcement happens at the process level, the code of any two packages cannot normally run in the same process, since they need to run as different Linux users. You can use the ``sharedUserId`` attribute in the ``AndroidManifest.xml``'s manifest tag of each package to have them assigned the same user ID. By doing this, for purposes of security the two packages are then treated as being the same application, with the same user ID and file permissions. Note that in order to retain security, only two applications signed with the same signature (and requesting the same sharedUserId) will be given the same user ID.可以在应用的manifest文件中设置``sharedUserId``来为两个应用分配相同的UserID，也就有了相同的文件访问权限。为了保证安全，只有两个签名相同的应用才会被分配相同的UserID。

Any data stored by an application will be assigned that application's user ID, and not normally accessible to other packages. When creating a new file with ``getSharedPreferences(String, int)``, ``openFileOutput(String, int)``, or ``openOrCreateDatabase(String, int, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory)``, you can use the ``MODE_WORLD_READABLE`` and/or ``MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE`` flags to allow any other package to read/write the file. When setting these flags, the file is still owned by your application, but its global read and/or write permissions have been set appropriately so any other application can see it.一个应用存储的任意数据都会被设置为拥有者为应用的UserID，这样其他的应用就没有了访问权限。当应用创建文件时，使用方法``getSharedPreferences(String, int)``，``openFileOutput(String, int)``，或者 ``openOrCreateDatabase(String, int, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory)``时可以使用``MODE_WORLD_READABLE`` and/or ``MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE`` flags来允许其他的应用来读/写这个文件。设置了这样的flag之后，文件的拥有者依旧是创建这个文件的应用的UserId，但是其他应用已经有读/写权限，已经被设置了合适的权限来去获取这个文件。

At application install time, permissions requested by the application are granted to it by the package installer, based on checks against the signatures of the applications declaring those permissions and/or interaction with the user. No checks with the user are done while an application is running; the app is either granted a particular permission when installed, and can use that feature as desired, or the permission is not granted and any attempt to use the feature fails without prompting the user.应用请求的权限要么在安装时一次性由用户赋予，要么被用户拒绝而无法安装。

#App Components

##Intent and Intent Filters

Intents facilitate communication between components in several ways, there are three fundamental use-cases:
+ To start an activity:You can start a new instance of an Activity by passing an ``Intent`` to ``startActivity()``. The ``Intent`` describes the activity to start and carries any necessary data.If you want to receive a result from the activity when it finishes, call ``startActivityForResult()``. Your activity receives the result as a separate ``Intent`` object in your activity's ``onActivityResult()``callback.使用``startActivity()``或者``startActivityForResult()``启动``Activity``。
+ To start a service:You can start a service to perform a one-time operation (such as download a file) by passing an ``Intent`` to ``startService()``. The ``Intent`` describes the service to start and carries any necessary data.If the service is designed with a client-server interface, you can bind to the service from another component by passing an ``Intent`` to ``bindService()``.使用``startService()``或者``bindService()``来启动``Service``。
+ To deliver a broadcast:A broadcast is a message that any app can receive. The system delivers various broadcasts for system events, such as when the system boots up or the device starts charging. You can deliver a broadcast to other apps by passing an ``Intent`` to ``sendBroadcast()``, ``sendOrderedBroadcast()``, or ``sendStickyBroadcast()``.使用``sendBroadcast()``，``sendOrderedBroadcast()``或者``sendStickyBroadcast()``来发起广播。

Explicit intents specify the component to start by name (the fully-qualified class name). You'll typically use an explicit intent to start a component in your own app, because you know the class name of the activity or service you want to start.Implicit intents do not name a specific component, but instead declare a general action to perform, which allows a component from another app to handle it.显式Intent，隐式Intent。When you create an explicit intent to start an activity or service, the system immediately starts the app component specified in the Intent object.使用显式Intent来启动``Activity``或者``Service``时，系统会立即启动``Intent``指定的组件。When you create an implicit intent, the Android system finds the appropriate component to start by comparing the contents of the intent to the intent filters declared in the manifest file of other apps on the device. If the intent matches an intent filter, the system starts that component and delivers it the Intent object. If multiple intent filters are compatible, the system displays a dialog so the user can pick which app to use.使用隐式Intent时，Android系统会把这个Intent和系统中应用在manifest中声明的intent filter的内容相比较。若有一个相匹配，则启动这个组件，并把Intent传送给这个组件。若有多个匹配，系统会弹出对话框让用户选择使用哪个应用。An intent filter is an expression in an app's manifest file that specifies the type of intents that the component would like to receive. For instance, by declaring an intent filter for an activity, you make it possible for other apps to directly start your activity with a certain kind of intent. Likewise, if you do not declare any intent filters for an activity, then it can be started only with an explicit intent.manifest中的intent filter表明了组件想要接受的Intent类型。如果一个组件没有声明intent filter，则只能被显式Intent启动。启动``Service``时永远要使用显式Intent，否则不知道具体什么组件启动了Service。

The primary information contained in an Intent is the following:
+ ``Component name``:This field of the Intent is a ComponentName object, which you can specify using a fully qualified class name of the target component, including the package name of the app. For example, com.example.ExampleActivity. You can set the component name with setComponent(), setClass(), setClassName(), or with the Intent constructor.
+ ``Action``:A string that specifies the generic action to perform (such as view or pick).``ACTION_VIEW``:Use this action in an intent with ``startActivity()`` when you have some information that an activity can show to the user, such as a photo to view in a gallery app, or an address to view in a map app.
+ ``Data``:The URI (a Uri object) that references the data to be acted on and/or the MIME type of that data. The type of data supplied is generally dictated by the intent's action.To set only the data URI, call ``setData()``. To set only the MIME type, call ``setType()``. If necessary, you can set both explicitly with ``setDataAndType()``.
+ ``Category``:A string containing additional information about the kind of component that should handle the intent.``CATEGORY_BROWSABLE``,The target activity allows itself to be started by a web browser to display data referenced by a link—such as an image or an e-mail message.``CATEGORY_LAUNCHER``,The activity is the initial activity of a task and is listed in the system's application launcher.You can specify a category with ``addCategory()``.

These properties listed above (component name, action, data, and category) represent the defining characteristics of an intent. By reading these properties, the Android system is able to resolve which app component it should start.Android系统通过读取Intent的``Componnet name``,``action``,``data``和``category``信息，可以判断出哪个组件应该去启动。一个Intent也可以包含其他的信息，这些信息不影响它究竟是如何被解析的。However, an intent can carry additional information that does not affect how it is resolved to an app component. An intent can also supply:
+ ``Extras``:Key-value pairs that carry additional information required to accomplish the requested action.You can add extra data with various ``putExtra()`` methods, each accepting two parameters: the key name and the value. You can also create a ``Bundle`` object with all the extra data, then insert the ``Bundle`` in the Intent with ``putExtras()``.For example, when creating an intent to send an email with ``ACTION_SEND``, you can specify the "to" recipient with the ``EXTRA_EMAIL`` key, and specify the "subject" with the ``EXTRA_SUBJECT`` key.
+ ``Flags``:Flags defined in the Intent class that function as metadata for the intent. The flags may instruct the Android system how to launch an activity (for example, which task the activity should belong to) and how to treat it after it's launched (for example, whether it belongs in the list of recent activities).可以使用``setFlag()``方法来设置flag。

使用隐式Intent时，可以使用``resolveActivity``来确定Intent发起的Action有组件响应。 It's possible that a user won't have any apps that handle the implicit intent you send to ``startActivity()``. If that happens, the call will fail and your app will crash. To verify that an activity will receive the intent, call ``resolveActivity()`` on your Intent object. If the result is non-null, then there is at least one app that can handle the intent and it's safe to call ``startActivity()``. If the result is null, you should not use the intent and, if possible, you should disable the feature that issues the intent.

```java
// Create the text message with a string
Intent sendIntent = new Intent();
sendIntent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, textMessage);
sendIntent.setType(HTTP.PLAIN_TEXT_TYPE); // "text/plain" MIME type

// Verify that the intent will resolve to an activity
if (sendIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {
    startActivity(sendIntent);
}
```

仅仅列出所有可以响应这个Intent Action的应用列表，不让用户选择默认应用。However, if multiple apps can respond to the intent and the user might want to use a different app each time, you should explicitly show a chooser dialog. The chooser dialog asks the user to select which app to use for the action every time (the user cannot select a default app for the action).To show the chooser, create an ``Intent`` using ``createChooser()`` and pass it to ``startActivity()``.

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
...

// Always use string resources for UI text.
// This says something like "Share this photo with"
String title = getResources().getString(R.string.chooser_title);
// Create intent to show chooser
Intent chooser = Intent.createChooser(intent, title);

// Verify the intent will resolve to at least one activity
if (sendIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {
    startActivity(sendIntent);
}
```

To advertise which implicit intents your app can receive, declare one or more intent filters for each of your app components with an ``<intent-filter>`` element in your manifest file. Each intent filter specifies the type of intents it accepts based on the intent's action, data, and category. The system will deliver an implicit intent to your app component only if the intent can pass through one of your intent filters.要让组件接收隐式Intent，需要在应用的manifest文件中组件的``intent-filter``中声明``intent-filter``。若有匹配，系统会把隐式Intent传递给响应组件。

Each intent filter is defined by an ``<intent-filter>`` element in the app's manifest file, nested in the corresponding app component (such as an ``<activity>`` element). Inside the ``<intent-filter>``, you can specify the type of intents to accept using one or more of these three elements:``<intent-filter>``中可以声明的元素：
+ ``<action>``:Declares the intent action accepted, in the name attribute. The value must be the literal string value of an action, not the class constant.
+ ``<data>``:Declares the type of data accepted, using one or more attributes that specify various aspects of the data URI (scheme, host, port, path, etc.) and MIME type.
+ ``<category>``:Declares the intent category accepted, in the name attribute. The value must be the literal string value of an action, not the class constant.**In order to receive implicit intents, you must include the ``CATEGORY_DEFAULT`` category in the intent filter. The methods ``startActivity()`` and ``startActivityForResult()`` treat all intents as if they declared the ``CATEGORY_DEFAULT`` category. If you do not declare this category in your intent filter, no implicit intents will resolve to your activity.**It's okay to create a filter that includes more than one instance of ``<action>, <data>, or <category>``. If you do, you simply need to be certain that the component can handle any and all combinations of those filter elements.一个组件可以包含多个``<action>,<data>,<category>``域，只要声明``<intent-filter>``的组件能处理这些就可以。

```xml
<activity android:name="ShareActivity">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
        <data android:mimeType="text/plain"/>
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

To avoid inadvertently running a different app's Service, always use an explicit intent to start your own service and do not declare intent filters for your service.永远使用显式Intent来启动Service。

The ``ACTION_MAIN`` action indicates this is the main entry point and does not expect any intent data.The ``CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`` category indicates that this activity's icon should be placed in the system's app launcher. If the ``<activity>`` element does not specify an icon with icon, then the system uses the icon from the ``<application>`` element.These two must be paired together in order for the activity to appear in the app launcher.``ACTION_MAIN``和``CATEGORY_LAUNCHER``必须同时出现才能保证一个应用出现在桌面上。


A ``PendingIntent`` object is a wrapper around an ``Intent`` object. The primary purpose of a ``PendingIntent`` is to grant permission to a foreign application to use the contained Intent as if it were executed from your app's own process.``PendingIntent``常用于给外界应用授权。Major use cases for a pending intent include:

+ Declare an intent to be executed when the user performs an action with your Notification (the Android system's NotificationManager executes the Intent).
+ Declare an intent to be executed when the user performs an action with your App Widget (the Home screen app executes the Intent).
+ Declare an intent to be executed at a specified time in the future (the Android system's AlarmManager executes the Intent).

Because each Intent object is designed to be handled by a specific type of app component (either an Activity, a Service, or a BroadcastReceiver), so too must a PendingIntent be created with the same consideration. 每个Intent都被设计用来处理特定类型的组件调用，PendingIntent也不例外，只不过调用方法有些区别。When using a pending intent, your app will not execute the intent with a call such as startActivity(). You must instead declare the intended component type when you create the PendingIntent by calling the respective creator method:
+ ``PendingIntent.getActivity()`` for an ``Intent`` that starts an ``Activity``.
+ ``PendingIntent.getService()`` for an ``Intent`` that starts a ``Service``.
+ ``PendingIntent.getBroadcast()`` for a ``Intent`` that starts an ``BroadcastReceiver``.
Unless your app is receiving pending intents from other apps, the above methods to create a ``PendingIntent`` are the only ``PendingIntent`` methods you'll probably ever need.

解析Intent时，如果有Intent中有一个匹配就pass，因此如果Intent中没有指定``action,data,category``，``<intent-filter>``中有相应的字段，会pass。For an intent to pass the category test, every category in the Intent must match a category in the filter. The reverse is not necessary—the intent filter may declare more categories than are specified in the Intent and the Intent will still pass. Therefore, an intent with no categories should always pass this test, regardless of what categories are declared in the filter.

Intents are matched against intent filters not only to discover a target component to activate, but also to discover something about the set of components on the device. For example, the Home app populates the app launcher by finding all the activities with intent filters that specify the ``ACTION_MAIN`` action and ``CATEGORY_LAUNCHER category``.可以根据``<intent-filter>``来对应用程序分类。Your application can use intent matching in a similar way. The ``PackageManager`` has a set of ``query...()`` methods that return all components that can accept a particular intent, and a similar series of ``resolve...()`` methods that determine the best component to respond to an intent. For example, ``queryIntentActivities()`` returns a list of all activities that can perform the intent passed as an argument, and ``queryIntentServices()`` returns a similar list of services. Neither method activates the components; they just list the ones that can respond. There's a similar method, ``queryBroadcastReceivers()``, for broadcast receivers.可以使用``PackageManager``相应方法来根据``Intent``来进行查询。

## Activities

Each time a new activity starts, the previous activity is stopped, but the system preserves the activity in a stack (the "back stack"). When a new activity starts, it is pushed onto the back stack and takes user focus. The back stack abides to the basic "last in, first out" stack mechanism, so, when the user is done with the current activity and presses the Back button, it is popped from the stack (and destroyed) and the previous activity resumes.task栈。

When an activity is stopped because a new activity starts, it is notified of this change in state through the activity's lifecycle callback methods. There are several callback methods that an activity might receive, due to a change in its state—whether the system is creating it, stopping it, resuming it, or destroying it—and each callback provides you the opportunity to perform specific work that's appropriate to that state change.Activity状态发生变化时，会调用相应的回调函数。

Sometimes, you might want to receive a result from the activity that you start. In that case, start the activity by calling ``startActivityForResult()`` (instead of ``startActivity()``). To then receive the result from the subsequent activity, implement the ``onActivityResult()`` callback method. When the subsequent activity is done, it returns a result in an Intent to your ``onActivityResult()`` method.

```java
private void pickContact() {
    // Create an intent to "pick" a contact, as defined by the content provider URI
    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK, Contacts.CONTENT_URI);
    startActivityForResult(intent, PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST);
}

@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    // If the request went well (OK) and the request was PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST
    if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK && requestCode == PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST) {
        // Perform a query to the contact's content provider for the contact's name
        Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(data.getData(),
        new String[] {Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME}, null, null, null);
        if (cursor.moveToFirst()) { // True if the cursor is not empty
            int columnIndex = cursor.getColumnIndex(Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME);
            String name = cursor.getString(columnIndex);
            // Do something with the selected contact's name...
        }
    }
}
```

You can shut down an activity by calling its ``finish()`` method. You can also shut down a separate activity that you previously started by calling ``finishActivity()``.

An activity can exist in essentially three states:
+ Resumed:The activity is in the foreground of the screen and has user focus. (This state is also sometimes referred to as "running".)
+ Paused:Another activity is in the foreground and has focus, but this one is still visible. That is, another activity is visible on top of this one and that activity is partially transparent or doesn't cover the entire screen. A paused activity is completely alive (the Activity object is retained in memory, it maintains all state and member information, and remains attached to the window manager), but can be killed by the system in extremely low memory situations.
+ Stopped:The activity is completely obscured by another activity (the activity is now in the "background"). A stopped activity is also still alive (the Activity object is retained in memory, it maintains all state and member information, but is not attached to the window manager). However, it is no longer visible to the user and it can be killed by the system when memory is needed elsewhere.

If an activity is paused or stopped, the system can drop it from memory either by asking it to finish (calling its finish() method), or simply killing its process. When the activity is opened again (after being finished or killed), it must be created all over.当一个Activity处于paused或者stopped状态时，系统可以从内存中清除它通过调用它的finish方法或者直接杀死它的进程。

```java
public class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        // The activity is being created.
    }
    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        // The activity is about to become visible.
    }
    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        // The activity has become visible (it is now "resumed").
    }
    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        // Another activity is taking focus (this activity is about to be "paused").
    }
    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        // The activity is no longer visible (it is now "stopped")
    }
    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        // The activity is about to be destroyed.
    }
}
```

Taken together, these methods define the entire lifecycle of an activity. By implementing these methods, you can monitor three nested loops in the activity lifecycle:
+ The entire lifetime of an activity happens between the call to ``onCreate()`` and the call to ``onDestroy()``. Your activity should perform setup of "global" state (such as defining layout) in ``onCreate()``, and release all remaining resources in ``onDestroy()``.Activity的整个生命周期在``onCreate``和``onDestory``之间。应该在``onCreate``中做些初始化工作，在``onDestory``中做销毁工作。
+ The **visible** lifetime of an activity happens between the call to ``onStart()`` and the call to ``onStop()``. During this time, the user can see the activity on-screen and interact with it.可以在``onStart``中注册广播，在``onStop``中解除注册。
+ The **foreground** lifetime of an activity happens between the call to ``onResume()`` and the call to ``onPause()``. During this time, the activity is in front of all other activities on screen and has user input focus. An activity can frequently transition in and out of the foreground—for example, ``onPause()`` is called when the device goes to sleep or when a dialog appears. Because this state can transition often, the code in these two methods should be fairly lightweight in order to avoid slow transitions that make the user wait.Activity状态切换会经常在``onPause``和``onResume``中发生，``onResume``和``onPause``中的代码应该尽量轻量级。

The system can kill the process hosting the activity at any time after the method(``onPause()``, ``onStop()``, and ``onDestroy()``) returns, without executing another line of the activity's code.在``onPause,onStop,onDestory``执行完返回后，系统可能会杀死它们。Because ``onPause()`` is the first of the three, once the activity is created, ``onPause()`` is the last method that's guaranteed to be called before the process can be killed—if the system must recover memory in an emergency, then ``onStop()`` and ``onDestroy()`` might not be called. Therefore, you should use ``onPause()`` to write crucial persistent data (such as user edits) to storage.应该在``onPause``中做一些重要的工作，比如存储数据之类的。

You can ensure that important information about the activity state is preserved by implementing an additional callback method that allows you to save information about the state of your activity: ``onSaveInstanceState()``.为了避免系统在资源紧张的情况下杀死Activity，可以使用``onSaveInstanceState``来保存现在的状态信息。The system calls ``onSaveInstanceState()`` before making the activity vulnerable to destruction. The system passes this method a ``Bundle`` in which you can save state information about the activity as name-value pairs, using methods such as ``putString()`` and ``putInt()``. Then, if the system kills your application process and the user navigates back to your activity, the system recreates the activity and passes the ``Bundle`` to both ``onCreate()`` and ``onRestoreInstanceState()``. Using either of these methods, you can extract your saved state from the ``Bundle`` and restore the activity state. If there is no state information to restore, then the ``Bundle`` passed to you is ``null`` (which is the case when the activity is created for the first time).系统会在Activity被销毁之前调用``onSaveInstanceState``，系统传递给这个方法一个``Bundle``来作为参数，可以使用``putString``或者``putInt``方法来保存需要保存的数据。当系统杀死了这个``Activity``，用户回到这个``Activity``时，系统会重新创建``Activity``并且会把这个``Bundle``对象传递给``onCreate``和``onRestoreInstanceState``。使用他们中的任意一个，都可以从``Bundle``中得到数据恢复之前的状态。

There's no guarantee that ``onSaveInstanceState()`` will be called before your activity is destroyed, because there are cases in which it won't be necessary to save the state (such as when the user leaves your activity using the Back button, because the user is explicitly closing the activity). If the system calls ``onSaveInstanceState()``, it does so before ``onStop()`` and possibly before ``onPause()``.系统不能保证在Activity被杀死之前调用``onSaveInstanceState``，因为有时不需要保存状态。系统调用``onSaveInstanceState``发生在``onStop``之前或者在``onPause``之前。

However, even if you do nothing and do not implement ``onSaveInstanceState()``, some of the activity state is restored by the ``Activity`` class's default implementation of ``onSaveInstanceState()``. Specifically, the default implementation calls the corresponding ``onSaveInstanceState()`` method for every ``View`` in the layout, which allows each view to provide information about itself that should be saved. Almost every widget in the Android framework implements this method as appropriate, such that any visible changes to the UI are automatically saved and restored when your activity is recreated. For example, the ``EditText`` widget saves any text entered by the user and the ``CheckBox`` widget saves whether it's checked or not. The only work required by you is to provide a unique ID (with the ``android:id`` attribute) for each widget you want to save its state. If a widget does not have an ID, then the system cannot save its state.即使在``onSaveInstanceState``中什么都不做，Activity的一些状态也是会被保存下来。``onSaveInstanceState``的默认实现是调用layout中每个``View``的对应的``onSaveInstanceState``方法，每个``View``的默认``onSaveInstanceState``方法会提供自身需要保存的信息。基本上每个``View``组件都实现了这个方法来保存自身的状态。需要做的仅仅是给需要保存状态的组件一个``id``，在manifest文件中提供``android:id``属性。如果一个组件没有id，就不能保存他的状态。You can also explicitly stop a view in your layout from saving its state by setting the ``android:saveEnabled`` attribute to "false" or by calling the ``setSaveEnabled()`` method. Usually, you should not disable this, but you might if you want to restore the state of the activity UI differently.可以显式的设置一个``View``的``android:saveEnabled``属性为``false``或者调用组件的``setSaveEnabled``方法来设置``View``组件是否保存自身的状态。Because the default implementation of ``onSaveInstanceState()`` helps save the state of the UI, if you override the method in order to save additional state information, you should always call the superclass implementation of ``onSaveInstanceState()`` before doing any work. Likewise, you should also call the superclass implementation of ``onRestoreInstanceState()`` if you override it, so the default implementation can restore view states.在``onSaveInstanceState``和``onRestoreInstanceState``方法中别忘了调用父类的对应方法。

Because ``onSaveInstanceState()`` is not guaranteed to be called, you should use it only to record the transient state of the activity (the state of the UI)—you should never use it to store persistent data. Instead, you should use ``onPause()`` to store persistent data (such as data that should be saved to a database) when the user leaves the activity.``onSaveInstanceState``方法不一定保证执行，应该在``onPause``中做数据持久化工作。

When one activity starts another, they both experience lifecycle transitions. The first activity pauses and stops (though, it won't stop if it's still visible in the background), while the other activity is created. In case these activities share data saved to disc or elsewhere, it's important to understand that the first activity is not completely stopped before the second one is created. Rather, the process of starting the second one overlaps with the process of stopping the first one.当一个``Activity``启动另外一个``Activity``时，他们的生命周期都会发生变化。

The order of lifecycle callbacks is well defined, particularly when the two activities are in the same process and one is starting the other. Here's the order of operations that occur when Activity A starts Acivity B:
+ Activity A's ``onPause()`` method executes.
+ Activity B's ``onCreate()``, ``onStart()``, and ``onResume()`` methods execute in sequence. (Activity B now has user focus.)
+ Then, if Activity A is no longer visible on screen, its ``onStop()`` method executes.

### Fragments

A fragment must always be embedded in an activity and the fragment's lifecycle is directly affected by the host activity's lifecycle. For example, when the activity is paused, so are all fragments in it, and when the activity is destroyed, so are all fragments. However, while an activity is running (it is in the ``resumed`` lifecycle state), you can manipulate each fragment independently, such as add or remove them. When you perform such a fragment transaction, you can also add it to a back stack that's managed by the activity—each back stack entry in the activity is a record of the fragment transaction that occurred. The back stack allows the user to reverse a fragment transaction (navigate backwards), by pressing the Back button.一个Fragment必须嵌入到一个Activity中，这个fragment的生命周期也受这个activity生命周期的影响。Activity在运行的时候，可以对每个fragment单独操作，add或者remove，或者将这个fragment放入到back stack中。

When you add a fragment as a part of your activity layout, it lives in a ``ViewGroup`` inside the activity's view hierarchy and the fragment defines its own view layout. You can insert a fragment into your activity layout by declaring the fragment in the activity's layout file, as a ``<fragment>`` element, or from your application code by adding it to an existing ``ViewGroup``. However, a fragment is not required to be a part of the activity layout; you may also use a fragment without its own UI as an invisible worker for the activity.可以在layout中以``<fragment>``元素的形式声明。也可以在代码中将一个``fragment``add到一个``ViewGroup``中。不是所有的``fragment``都需要UI，有的``fragment``也可以在后台作为worker来为activity服务。

The Fragment class has code that looks a lot like an Activity. It contains callback methods similar to an activity, such as ``onCreate()``, ``onStart()``, ``onPause()``, and ``onStop()``.Fragment的回调方法和Activity的回调方法类似。

``DialogFragment``，``ListFragment``，``PreferenceFragment``是``Fragment``的几个子类。

To provide a layout for a fragment, you must implement the ``onCreateView()`` callback method, which the Android system calls when it's time for the fragment to draw its layout. Your implementation of this method must return a ``View`` that is the root of your fragment's layout.如果fragment需要布局，必须重载``onCreateView``方法，并且返回一个``View``作为fragment的root view。If your fragment is a subclass of ``ListFragment``, the default implementation returns a ``ListView`` from ``onCreateView()``, so you don't need to implement it.To return a layout from ``onCreateView()``, you can inflate it from a layout resource defined in XML. To help you do so, ``onCreateView()`` provides a ``LayoutInflater`` object.

```java
public static class ExampleFragment extends Fragment {
    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        // Inflate the layout for this fragment
        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.example_fragment, container, false);
    }
}
```
The ``container`` parameter passed to ``onCreateView()`` is the parent ``ViewGroup`` (from the activity's layout) in which your fragment layout will be inserted. The ``savedInstanceState`` parameter is a ``Bundle`` that provides data about the previous instance of the fragment, if the fragment is being resumed.

```xml
<fragment
	android:name="com.example.news.ArticleListFragment"
	android:id="@+id/list"
	android:layout_weight="1"
	android:layout_width="0dp"
	android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

The ``android:name`` attribute in the ``<fragment>`` specifies the ``Fragment`` class to instantiate in the layout.When the system creates this activity layout, it instantiates each fragment specified in the layout and calls the ``onCreateView()`` method for each one, to retrieve each fragment's layout. The system inserts the ``View`` returned by the fragment directly in place of the ``<fragment>`` element.系统创建activity时会把fragment的``onCreateView``返回的``View``放到activity布局文件中fragment的相对应位置。

Each fragment requires a unique identifier that the system can use to restore the fragment if the activity is restarted (and which you can use to capture the fragment to perform transactions, such as remove it).为fragment提供一个id可以方便系统对fragment在activity上做操作。 There are three ways to provide an ID for a fragment:
+ Supply the ``android:id`` attribute with a unique ID.
+ Supply the ``android:tag`` attribute with a unique string.
+ If you provide neither of the previous two, the system uses the ID of the container view.

At any time while your activity is running, you can add fragments to your activity layout. You simply need to specify a ``ViewGroup`` in which to place the fragment.``Activity``运行时，可以将``fragment``添加到activty的布局中。

To make fragment transactions in your activity (such as add, remove, or replace a fragment), you must use APIs from ``FragmentTransaction``. 使用``FragmentTransaction``提供的API来操作```Fragment``，比如添加移除替换等。You can get an instance of ``FragmentTransaction`` from your ``Activity`` like this:

```java
FragmentManager fragmentManager = getFragmentManager()
FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
```

You can then add a fragment using the ``add()`` method, specifying the fragment to add and the view in which to insert it. For example:

```java
ExampleFragment fragment = new ExampleFragment();
fragmentTransaction.add(R.id.fragment_container, fragment);
fragmentTransaction.commit();
```

The first argument passed to ``add()`` is the ``ViewGroup`` in which the fragment should be placed, specified by resource ID, and the second parameter is the fragment to add.Once you've made your changes with ``FragmentTransaction``, you must call ``commit()`` for the changes to take effect.

You can also use a fragment to provide a background behavior for the activity without presenting additional UI.To add a fragment without a UI, add the fragment from the activity using ``add(Fragment, String)`` (supplying a unique string "tag" for the fragment, rather than a view ID). This adds the fragment, but, because it's not associated with a view in the activity layout, it does not receive a call to ``onCreateView()``. So you don't need to implement that method.也可以使用fragment来为activity提供后台操作而不提供UI。Supplying a string tag for the fragment isn't strictly for non-UI fragments—you can also supply string tags to fragments that do have a UI—but if the fragment does not have a UI, then the string tag is the only way to identify it. If you want to get the fragment from the activity later, you need to use ``findFragmentByTag()``.为fragment指定一个tag可以方便以后使用``FragmentManager``操作。[https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentRetainInstance.java](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentRetainInstance.java)

To manage the fragments in your activity, you need to use ``FragmentManager``. To get it, call ``getFragmentManager()`` from your activity.使用Activity的``getFragmentManager``可以得到``FragmentManager``。Some things that you can do with ``FragmentManager`` include:
+ Get fragments that exist in the activity, with ``findFragmentById()`` (for fragments that provide a UI in the activity layout) or ``findFragmentByTag()`` (for fragments that do or don't provide a UI).
+ Pop fragments off the back stack, with ``popBackStack()`` (simulating a Back command by the user).
+ Register a listener for changes to the back stack, with ``addOnBackStackChangedListener()``.
+ You can also use ``FragmentManager`` to open a ``FragmentTransaction``, which allows you to perform transactions, such as add and remove fragments.

Before you call ``commit()``, however, you might want to call ``addToBackStack()``, in order to add the transaction to a back stack of fragment transactions. This back stack is managed by the activity and allows the user to return to the previous fragment state, by pressing the Back button.调用``FragmentTransaction``的``commit``方法之前，可以调用``addToBackStack``方法来将操作压栈。

The order in which you add changes to a ``FragmentTransaction`` doesn't matter, except:
+ You must call ``commit()`` last
+ If you're adding multiple fragments to the same container, then the order in which you add them determines the order they appear in the view hierarchy

If you do not call ``addToBackStack()`` when you perform a transaction that removes a fragment, then that fragment is destroyed when the transaction is committed and the user cannot navigate back to it. Whereas, if you do call ``addToBackStack()`` when removing a fragment, then the fragment is stopped and will be resumed if the user navigates back.如果不执行压栈操作，当执行``FragmentTransaction``的``commit``操作时，返回到原来的fragment时，原来的fragment就会被销毁，用户就返回不到原来的fragment了。相反，当移除一个fragment时，执行``addToBackStack``，这个fragment就会stop，用户返回时fragment就会恢复成resume状态。For each fragment transaction, you can apply a transition animation, by calling ``setTransition()`` before you commit.在``FragmentTransaction``每次提交事物之前，可以使用``setTransition``来为fragment transaction设置动画。

Calling ``commit()`` does not perform the transaction immediately. Rather, it schedules it to run on the activity's UI thread (the "main" thread) as soon as the thread is able to do so. If necessary, however, you may call ``executePendingTransactions()`` from your UI thread to immediately execute transactions submitted by ``commit()``. Doing so is usually not necessary unless the transaction is a dependency for jobs in other threads.调用``FragmentTransaction``的``commit``方法并不会立即执行transaction。相反，他会将其调度到UI主线程。可以从UI线程来调用``executePendingTransactions``来立即执行由``commit``提交的事务。

You can commit a transaction using ``commit()`` only prior to the activity saving its state (when the user leaves the activity). If you attempt to commit after that point, an exception will be thrown. This is because the state after the commit can be lost if the activity needs to be restored. For situations in which its okay that you lose the commit, use ``commitAllowingStateLoss()``.只能在activity保存自身状态之前使用``FragmentTransaction``来``commit``，如果在保存状态之后再次调用``FragmentTransaction``的``commit``，会触发异常。这是因为在activity保存状态之后``FragmentTransaction``进行的提交可能会在activity恢复状态之后丢失。如果不关注``FragmentTransaction``进行提交后可能导致的状态丢失，可以使用``FragmentTransaction``的``commitAllowingStateLoss``方法。

Specifically, the fragment can access the ``Activity`` instance with ``getActivity()`` and easily perform tasks such as find a view in the activity layout:``View listView = getActivity().findViewById(R.id.list);``.在``Fragment``中可以使用``getActivity``得到``Activity``的引用，进而调用``Activity``的相应方法来获取布局中的相应``View``。Likewise, your activity can call methods in the fragment by acquiring a reference to the ``Fragment`` from ``FragmentManager``, using ``findFragmentById()`` or ``findFragmentByTag()``. For example:``ExampleFragment fragment = (ExampleFragment) getFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.example_fragment);``.相对应的，在Activity中也可以调用``getFragmentManager``来获取``FragmentManager``来进行相应的操作取得fragment的引用。

In some cases, you might need a fragment to share events with the activity. A good way to do that is to define a callback interface inside the fragment and require that the host activity implement it. When the activity receives a callback through the interface, it can share the information with other fragments in the layout as necessary.当一个Fragment需要和Activity共享一些事件的处理时，一个好的方式是在``Fragment``中定义一个接口，让``Fragment``绑定到的那个``Activity``来实现这个接口，当``Activity``接收到事件处理的回调时，就实现了``Fragment``和``Activity``之间的信息共享。

Fragment中也可以添加Menu Item到Menu或者Action Bar，具体可以看官方文档。

Also like an activity, you can retain the state of a fragment using a ``Bundle``, in case the activity's process is killed and you need to restore the fragment state when the activity is recreated. You can save the state during the fragment's ``onSaveInstanceState()`` callback and restore it during either ``onCreate()``, ``onCreateView()``, or ``onActivityCreated()``. 和``Activity``类似，可以使用``Bundle``来恢复一个``Fragment``的状态。可以在``Fragment``的``onSaveInstanceState``回调方法中保存状态，在``onCreate``和``onCreateView``或者``onActivityCreated``中恢复状态。

The most significant difference in lifecycle between an activity and a fragment is how one is stored in its respective back stack. An activity is placed into a back stack of activities that's managed by the system when it's stopped, by default (so that the user can navigate back to it with the Back button). However, a fragment is placed into a back stack managed by the host activity only when you explicitly request that the instance be saved by calling ``addToBackStack()`` during a transaction that removes the fragment.``Activity``和``Fragment``的一个显著区别是，``Activity``的回退栈是由系统维护的，``Fragment``的回退栈只有在调用``addToBackStack``时才会由host activity来放入并维护。

 If you need a ``Context`` object within your ``Fragment``, you can call ``getActivity()``. However, be careful to call ``getActivity()`` only when the fragment is attached to an activity. When the fragment is not yet attached, or was detached during the end of its lifecycle, ``getActivity()`` will return null.在``Fragment``中调用``getActivity``方法获取``Activity``引用时必须确认``Fragment``是和``Activity`` attached的，否则在``Fragment``中调用``getActivity``会返回null。

 ``Fragment``的生命周期和``Activity``的生命周期紧密绑定在一起，比如，``Activity``接收到``onPause``时，每个attach到这个``Activity``的``Fragment``也会收到``onPause``。除此之外，``Fragment``还有几个额外的方法：
 + ``onAttach()``,Called when the fragment has been associated with the activity (the Activity is passed in here).
+ ``onCreateView()``,Called to create the view hierarchy associated with the fragment.
+ ``onActivityCreated()``,Called when the activity's ``onCreate()`` method has returned.
+ ``onDestroyView()``,Called when the view hierarchy associated with the fragment is being removed.
+ ``onDetach()``,Called when the fragment is being disassociated from the activity.

Once the activity reaches the resumed state, you can freely add and remove fragments to the activity. Thus, only while the activity is in the resumed state can the lifecycle of a fragment change independently.However, when the activity leaves the resumed state, the fragment again is pushed through its lifecycle by the activity.只有在activity处于resumed状态下，可以在activity中自由的添加或者删除fragment。因此，也只有在activity处于resumed状态下时，fragment的状态可以自由切换。当activity离开了resumed状态，fragment的状态还是会受到activity状态转换的左右。


### Loaders

为什么要用Loader？用AsyncTask来进行后台处理不是挺好的吗？

[android-loaders-the-way-to-go](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10422697/android-loaders-the-way-to-go),[can-honeycomb-loaders-solve-problems-with-asynctask-ui-update](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5097565/can-honeycomb-loaders-solve-problems-with-asynctask-ui-update),[an-introduction-to-loaders-in-android](http://amsanjeev.wordpress.com/2011/09/23/an-introduction-to-loaders-in-android/)

One problem your code has which loaders aim to fix is what happens if your activity is restarted (say due to device rotation or config change) while your async task is still in progress? in your case your restarted activity will start a 2nd instance of the task and throw away the results from the first one. When the first one completes you can end up with crashes due to the fact your async task has a reference is what is now a finished activity.And yes using loaders often makes for more/more complex code, particularly if you can't use one of the provided loaders.使用AsyncTask时，如果遇到AsyncTask引用的那个Activity被销毁(比如后台数据在处理，而屏幕旋转了，或用户按下了back等等)，会导致AsyncTask持有一个已经finish的Acitivy的引用，也就更新不了Acitivy的UI了。

Loader also persist the data fetched to avoid repetitive fetch operations for simple activity refresh event like orientation change, keyboard open etc. Internally loaders also use async tasks to perform the data load. So there is no performance gain that one would notice when compared to async tasks, provide that the async tasks are designed and developed properly.Loader在内部使用AsyncTask来执行数据加载，和单独使用AsyncTask没有什么性能上的差别，而且还可以应对configuration change等问题。

There are multiple classes and interfaces that may be involved in using loaders in an application.

+ ``LoaderManager``: An abstract class associated with an ``Activity`` or ``Fragment`` for managing one or more Loader instances. This helps an application manage longer-running operations in conjunction with the ``Activity`` or ``Fragment`` lifecycle; the most common use of this is with a ``CursorLoader``, however applications are free to write their own loaders for loading other types of data. ``LoaderManager``是和``Activity``或``Fragment``关联的一个抽象类，它会帮助一个应用在``Activity``或``Fragment``生命周期内处理长时间运行的操作。There is only one ``LoaderManager`` per activity or fragment. But a ``LoaderManager`` can have multiple loaders.一个``Activity``或者``Fragment``只有一个``LoaderManager``，但是一个``LoaderManager``可以有多个loader。
+ ``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks``:A callback interface for a client to interact with the ``LoaderManager``. For example, you use the ``onCreateLoader()`` callback method to create a new loader.客户端和``LoaderManager``进行交互的回调接口。
+ ``Loader``:An abstract class that performs asynchronous loading of data. This is the base class for a loader. You would typically use ``CursorLoader``, but you can implement your own subclass. While loaders are active they should monitor the source of their data and deliver new results when the contents change.一个执行异步加载数据的抽象类。
+ ``AsyncTaskLoader``:Abstract loader that provides an ``AsyncTask`` to do the work.一个提供``AsyncTask``来做工作的抽象loader。
+ ``CursorLoader``:A subclass of ``AsyncTaskLoader`` that queries the ``ContentResolver`` and returns a ``Cursor``. This class implements the ``Loader`` protocol in a standard way for querying cursors, building on ``AsyncTaskLoader`` to perform the cursor query on a background thread so that it does not block the application's UI. Using this loader is the best way to asynchronously load data from a ``ContentProvider``, instead of performing a managed query through the fragment or activity's APIs.``CursorLoader``是``AsyncTaskLoader``的子类，它会去查询``ContentResolver``然后返回一个``Cursor``。``CursorLoader``是从``ContentProvider``中异步加载数据的最好方式。

An application that uses loaders typically includes the following:

+ An ``Activity`` or ``Fragment``.
+ An instance of the ``LoaderManager``.
+ A ``CursorLoader`` to load data backed by a ``ContentProvider``. Alternatively, you can implement your own subclass of ``Loader`` or ``AsyncTaskLoader`` to load data from some other source.
+ An implementation for ``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks``. This is where you create new loaders and manage your references to existing loaders.
+ A way of displaying the loader's data, such as a ``SimpleCursorAdapter``.
+ A data source, such as a ``ContentProvider``, when using a ``CursorLoader``.

#### Starting & Restarting a Loader
You typically initialize a ``Loader`` within the activity's ``onCreate()`` method, or within the fragment's ``onActivityCreated()`` method.

```java
// Prepare the loader.  Either re-connect with an existing one,
// or start a new one.
getLoaderManager().initLoader(0, null, this);
```
``initLoader``有3个参数
+ A unique ID that identifies the loader.``Loader``的ID
+ Optional arguments to supply to the loader at construction.可选的在loader构建时使用的参数。
+ A ``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks`` implementation, which the ``LoaderManager`` calls to report loader events.一个实现了``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks``接口的类，``LoaderManager``会在事件触发时使用其中的方法。

The ``initLoader()`` call ensures that a loader is initialized and active.
+ If the loader specified by the ID already exists, the last created loader is reused.如果``initLoader``使用的loader ID已经存在，之前创建的loader会被重用。
+ If the loader specified by the ID does not exist, ``initLoader()`` triggers the ``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks`` method ``onCreateLoader()``. This is where you implement the code to instantiate and return a new loader.如果``initLoader``使用的loader ID不存在，``initLoader``会触发``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks``中的``onCreateLoader``方法，在这个自己实现的方法中可以去做一些初始化工作。

In either case, the given ``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks`` implementation is associated with the loader, and will be called when the loader state changes. If at the point of this call the caller is in its started state, and the requested loader already exists and has generated its data, then the system calls ``onLoadFinished()`` immediately (during ``initLoader()``).在调用``initLoader``时，如果``loader``已经存在，系统会立即调用``onLoadFinished``。Note that the ``initLoader()`` method returns the ``Loader`` that is created, but you don't need to capture a reference to it. The ``LoaderManager`` manages the life of the loader automatically. The ``LoaderManager`` starts and stops loading when necessary, and maintains the state of the loader and its associated content.``initLoader``方法会返回创建的``Loader``，但不用保持对它的引用，``LoaderManager``会自动管理``Loader``的生命周期，会管理loader的状态和与loader关联的数据。

When you use ``initLoader()``,it uses an existing loader with the specified ID if there is one. If there isn't, it creates one. But sometimes you want to discard your old data and start over.To discard your old data, you use ``restartLoader()``.在使用``initLoader``时，他会重用已存在的loader或者创建一个新的loader。有时需要丢弃旧的数据重新绑定数据源，这时，需要使用``restartLoader``。


#### Using the LoaderManager Callbacks

``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks``  is a callback interface that lets a client interact with the ``LoaderManager``.``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks``是客户端和``LoaderManager``进行交互的回调接口。 ``Loaders``, in particular ``CursorLoader``, are expected to retain their data after being stopped. This allows applications to keep their data across the activity or fragment's ``onStop()`` and ``onStart()`` methods, so that when users return to an application, they don't have to wait for the data to reload. You use the ``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks`` methods to know when to create a new loader, and to tell the application when it is time to stop using a loader's data.使用``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks``方法来分辨什么时候创建一个新的``loader``，告诉应用什么时候去停止使用一个``Loader``的数据源。

``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks`` includes these methods:
+ ``onCreateLoader()`` — Instantiate and return a new Loader for the given ID.When you attempt to access a loader (for example, through ``initLoader()``), it checks to see whether the loader specified by the ID exists. If it doesn't, it triggers the ``LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks`` method ``onCreateLoader()``. This is where you create a new loader. Typically this will be a ``CursorLoader``, but you can implement your own ``Loader`` subclass.
+ ``onLoadFinished()`` — Called when a previously created loader has finished its load.This method is called when a previously created loader has finished its load. This method is guaranteed to be called prior to the release of the last data that was supplied for this loader.``onLoadFinished``方法会在loader完成数据load时调用，这个方法保证会在数据源release之前调用。 At this point you should remove all use of the old data (since it will be released soon), but should not do your own release of the data since its loader owns it and will take care of that.这时应该释放旧的数据，但不应该自己释放而是应该由loader来释放。The loader will release the data once it knows the application is no longer using it. For example, if the data is a cursor from a ``CursorLoader``, you **should not** call ``close()`` on it yourself. If the cursor is being placed in a ``CursorAdapter``, you should use the ``swapCursor()`` method so that the old Cursor is not closed.不应该直接调用``CursorLoader``的``close``方法，而应该调用``CursorAdapter``的``swapCursor``方法。
```java
// This is the Adapter being used to display the list's data.
SimpleCursorAdapter mAdapter;
...

public void onLoadFinished(Loader<Cursor> loader, Cursor data) {
    // Swap the new cursor in.  (The framework will take care of closing the
    // old cursor once we return.)
    mAdapter.swapCursor(data);

+ ``onLoaderReset()`` — Called when a previously created loader is being reset, thus making its data unavailable.之前创建的loader被reset时，会调用``onLoaderReset``，这会使``Loader``的数据不可用。This callback lets you find out when the data is about to be released so you can remove your reference to it. 这个回调方法
```java
// This is the Adapter being used to display the list's data.
SimpleCursorAdapter mAdapter;
...

public void onLoaderReset(Loader<Cursor> loader) {
    // This is called when the last Cursor provided to onLoadFinished()
    // above is about to be closed.  We need to make sure we are no
    // longer using it.
    mAdapter.swapCursor(null);
}
```


### Tasks and Back Stack
一个应用可以发隐式Intent来激活另一个应用中的组件，其他应用中的声明了可以接收这个Intent的相对应的组件会被激活，就像是在同一个应用中一样。Even though the activities may be from different applications, Android maintains this seamless user experience by keeping both activities in the same task.尽管被激活的组件可能来自其他应用，Android通过将activities放在同一个task中来保证用户体验的流畅。

A task is a collection of activities that users interact with when performing a certain job. The activities are arranged in a stack (the "back stack"), in the order in which each activity is opened.

The device Home screen is the starting place for most tasks. When the user touches an icon in the application launcher (or a shortcut on the Home screen), that application's task comes to the foreground. If no task exists for the application (the application has not been used recently), then a new task is created and the "main" activity for that application opens as the root activity in the stack.Home桌面是大部分应用开始的地方，当一个应用之前被打开过，再次在launcher上点击应用时，那个应用的task会回到前台，如果点击的应用之前没有被打开过，一个新的task会被创建，应用的main activity作为stack的root activity入栈。

When the current activity starts another, the new activity is pushed on the top of the stack and takes focus. 当前Acitivy启动另一个Activity时，被启动的Acitivy会被push到task stack的顶部并获得focus。The previous activity remains in the stack, but is stopped. 之前的Acitivy还在task stack中，但是出于stopped状态。When an activity stops, the system retains the current state of its user interface. When the user presses the Back button, the current activity is popped from the top of the stack (the activity is destroyed) and the previous activity resumes (the previous state of its UI is restored).一个Activity出于stopped状态时，系统会保留Activity的当前状态，当用户按下back时，当前的Activity会从task stack中弹出被销毁，之前出于stopped状态的Activity会resume到之前的状态。 Activities in the stack are never rearranged, only pushed and popped from the stack—pushed onto the stack when started by the current activity and popped off when the user leaves it using the Back button. As such, the back stack operates as a "last in, first out" object structure.If the user continues to press Back, then each activity in the stack is popped off to reveal the previous one, until the user returns to the Home screen (or to whichever activity was running when the task began). When all activities are removed from the stack, the task no longer exists.当用户不停地按back时，back stack中的Activity不断pop出去，显示出stack top的Activity，直到用户返回到Home Screen或者这个task开始的时候启动的那个Activity，当所有的Activity都从stack中被移出时，task就不会存在了。

A task is a cohesive unit that can move to the "background" when users begin a new task or go to the Home screen, via the Home button. While in the background, all the activities in the task are stopped, but the back stack for the task remains intact—the task has simply lost focus while another task takes place.一个task是一个紧密的整体，可以被放入后台当用户启动一个新的task或者按下home时。一个task处于后台时，所有在该task中的Activity都会被stop，但是task中Activity组成的back stack会保持完整，只不过是失去了focus，其他的task取代了它获得了user focus。

Multiple tasks can be held in the background at once. However, if the user is running many background tasks at the same time, the system might begin destroying background activities in order to recover memory, causing the activity states to be lost.如果后台同时运行了太多task，系统可能会销毁background activity来恢复内存，导致Activity的状态丢失。

Because the activities in the back stack are never rearranged, if your application allows users to start a particular activity from more than one activity, a new instance of that activity is created and pushed onto the stack (rather than bringing any previous instance of the activity to the top). As such, one activity in your application might be instantiated multiple times (even from different tasks).因为在task stack中的Activity位置不会被重新组织，所以如果你的应用允许用户从不止一个Activity中启动你的组件Activity，你的被启动的那个组件Activity会被重新创建并且push到新的task stack中，而不是把之前Activity的实例带到前台，因此，你的应用中的一个Activity可能会被从不同的task中实例化多次。

To summarize the default behavior for activities and tasks:

+ When Activity A starts Activity B, Activity A is stopped, but the system retains its state (such as scroll position and text entered into forms). If the user presses the Back button while in Activity B, Activity A resumes with its state restored.Activity A启动Activity B时，A stop，但是系统会保留A的状态，如果在B中按下back，A的状态会被恢复。
+ When the user leaves a task by pressing the Home button, the current activity is stopped and its task goes into the background. The system retains the state of every activity in the task. If the user later resumes the task by selecting the launcher icon that began the task, the task comes to the foreground and resumes the activity at the top of the stack.用户按下Home时，当前的Activity会stop，所在的task会进入后台，系统会保留task中每个Activity的状态，如果以后用户重启task，task回到前台来，会resume back stack中栈top的Activity。
+ If the user presses the Back button, the current activity is popped from the stack and destroyed. The previous activity in the stack is resumed. When an activity is destroyed, the system does not retain the activity's state.用户按下back时，在back stack 栈顶的Activity会被弹出栈销毁掉，back stack栈中的Activity会被resume。Activity被销毁的时候，系统不会保存Activity的状态。
+ Activities can be instantiated multiple times, even from other tasks.一个Activity可以被实例化多次，即使是从其他的task中。

 In order to avoid losing the user's work, you should proactively retain it by implementing the ``onSaveInstanceState()`` callback methods in your activity.为了不丢失用户的信息，应该主动在``onSaveInstanceState``中保留用户的信息。

However, you might decide that you want to interrupt the normal behavior. Perhaps you want an activity in your application to begin a new task when it is started (instead of being placed within the current task); or, when you start an activity, you want to bring forward an existing instance of it (instead of creating a new instance on top of the back stack); or, you want your back stack to be cleared of all activities except for the root activity when the user leaves the task.You can do these things and more, with attributes in the ``<activity>`` manifest element and with flags in the intent that you pass to ``startActivity()``.如果需要更改Activity和Back Stack的默认交互方式，可以在manifest文件中的``activity``属性中设置，或者在传递给``startActivity``的Intent中设置flag。在manifest中，可以给``activity``设置的属性有``taskAffinity``，``launchMode``，``allowTaskReparenting``，``clearTaskOnLaunch``，``alwaysRetainTaskState``，``finishOnTaskLaunch``。在Intent中传递给``startActivity``的flag中可以设置的有``FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK``，``FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP``，``FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP``。

When declaring an activity in your manifest file, you can specify how the activity should associate with a task using the ``<activity>`` element's ``launchMode`` attribute.``launchMode``定义了Activity如何launch进入task，可以设置的属性有``standard``，``singleTop``，``singleTask``，``singleInstance``。

## Overview

## Layouts

+ ``android:id="@+id/my_button"`` The at-symbol (@) at the beginning of the string indicates that the XML parser should parse and expand the rest of the ID string and identify it as an ID resource. The plus-symbol (+) means that this is a new resource name that must be created and added to our resources (in the ``R.java`` file). There are a number of other ID resources that are offered by the Android framework. When referencing an Android resource ID, you do not need the plus-symbol, but must add the android package namespace, like so:``android:id="@android:id/empty"``,With the android package namespace in place, we're now referencing an ID from the ``android.R`` resources class, rather than the local resources class.
+ XML layout attributes named ``layout_something`` define layout parameters for the ``View`` that are appropriate for the ``ViewGroup`` in which it resides.
+ Every ViewGroup class implements a nested class that extends ``ViewGroup.LayoutParams``. This subclass contains property types that define the size and position for each child view, as appropriate for the view group.每个``ViewGroup``都会实现一个继承自``ViewGroup.LayoutParams``的嵌套类。
+ In general, specifying a layout width and height using absolute units such as pixels is not recommended. Instead, using relative measurements such as density-independent pixel units (dp), wrap_content, or fill_parent, is a better approach, because it helps ensure that your application will display properly across a variety of device screen sizes.
